Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.

Module scope are available anywhere within the current module, but aren't available from other files or modules.


*******************
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
